All packages are @rmc/multiplayer-client. Before changing a shared protocol, review each game, update affected consumers and test public URLs. Short downtime and session loss are acceptable; leaving existing demos broken is not.

## Just Like Rabbits

`just-like-rabbits` is a twelve-seat shared habitat relay. The oldest active participant is elected host and publishes bounded transferable simulation snapshots; guests submit ordered cues, cultivation, and speed requests but never direct state. Departure promotes the next oldest active participant with the latest relay snapshot. The consumer pins the released shared-client package after a public two-client verification. Deployment can end in-memory rooms, but existing games retain their documented protocols unless a regression test proves otherwise.

## Enter the Gungeon Clone

`gungeon` — 1–4 players per private room code — shared client 0.9.7+ — [Live demo](https://samuelasherrivello.github.io/babylon-lite-enter-the-gungeon-clone/) — [Source](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/babylon-lite-enter-the-gungeon-clone). Server-authoritative wave arena, three weapons, upgrades, dodge, revive, coded rooms and hot join/drop. See the [coded-room workflow](../packages/client/README.md#coded-private-room-workflow), [admission](../src/server.ts#L39), and [room lifecycle](../src/private-code-room.ts#L14).

## Bomberman Clone

bomberman — 2–4 players, private codes, authoritative bomb arena, 15-second identity recovery. Version 0.9.4 adds capped bomb/range/speed pickups, telegraphed sudden death, automatic rounds, first-to-three matches and ready-gated rematches. A monotonic elapsed-time accumulator keeps fixed 60Hz simulation ticks consistent despite timer jitter; snapshots remain 20Hz. The published client pins 0.9.7 and requires six-character invites; this server generates six characters for Bomberman and also accepts recent four-character callers. Two public browsers verified a full first-to-three match and fresh rematch on 2026-10-01. Expired process-local rooms require recreation and host resets do not retain identity or scores. [Multiplayer preview](https://samuelasherrivello.github.io/babylon-lite-bomberman-clone/?mode=online).

## Street Fighter II Clone

`street-fighter-ii` supports private two-player invite rooms, server-authoritative 60 Hz combat, and per-seat 15-second recovery tokens. The client synchronizes game snapshots at 20 Hz and uses the shared combat rules from the versioned client package. Rooms and invites are in-memory and can be interrupted by process loss or serverless routing. [Demo in development](https://samuelasherrivello.github.io/babylon-lite-street-fighter-clone/).


## Music Maker Multiplayer

`music-maker` uses private four-seat codes and a host-browser event ledger. The server assigns fictional names, numbers and colors, stamps input origins, bounds messages and accepts publications only from the creator. It does not simulate musical time. Host disconnect ends the room without migration or grace. Guest reconnect creates a fresh identity while the host remains active. Existing game contracts are unchanged.
