# Design

## Context

See proposal.md. Baseline d01a2d6c uses core 0.17.44, SDK 0.17.43, Node24 and process-local rooms. server.ts serializes admission and has explicit game lists. PrivateCodeRoom provides bounded reconnect and lifecycle helpers but its room-code replacement cannot authorize reserved Tetris seats. Street Fighter broadcasts full snapshots; Tetris must project separately. The rabbits host relay broadcasts transferable full state and is unsuitable for private competitive boards.

## Goals / Non-Goals

Goals: one pure deterministic rules module, server authority, private views, additive client support, tested free Vercel relay.
Non-goals: modifying other games, participant-host authority, cross-instance persistence, paid hosting, external datastore, or completing unrelated migration changes.

## Decisions

Use packages/client/tetris-duel-rules.js for the engine and additive ./tetris-duel package export. Ten columns, 20 visible plus four hidden rows; seven integer-oriented shapes; horizontal kicks 0,-1,1,-2,2; independent identical seven-bags. Five-second deadlines auto-commit; manual commit freezes aim for 200ms straight first-collision descent. Lock/clear, FIFO cancel, batch simultaneous attacks, enqueue remaining 0/1/2/4 rows, insert mature incoming rows only at resolution after >=1000ms warning, then check overflow/hidden occupancy. Three-second ready countdown, top-out win/same-tick draw, both-ready rematch resets epoch. Pure projection sends only own board/queue/piece and opponent identity/readiness/connection/settled height/aim while aiming/outcome. Never expose seeds, other-seat credentials or opponent landing/fall/cells.

Implement TetrisRoom under src and register its private admission branch. Reuse PrivateCodeRoom lifecycle additively with token-scoped replacement, cumulative recovery budgets, and no room-code takeover. Token rotation on refresh invalidates prior token; SDK recovery retains seat. Pause clocks on detected loss, at most 15s cumulative per seat per match; explicit leave forfeits, both-offline expiry aborts. Validate protocol, epoch, piece, sequence, enum and 60 actions/s. Tick20ms using monotonic elapsed time; projected20Hz plus immediate transitions. The browser predicts local aim/commit only and reconciles acknowledgments.

Reuse MultiplayerClient for connection/status/resubscribe/teardown and opt Tetris into SDK recovery. Persist only its own admission token in sessionStorage scoped by endpoint/game/code, never URL. Terminal full/expired/invalid-token states are actionable. Preserve all existing exports.

User expressly requires existing server relay and free Vercel; this overrides create-game alternative-host/shared-store defaults. Extend the checked-in staged deploy workflow with Tetris integration before promotion. Retain 240s long-session probe and rollback. Function expiry/instance routing may lose rooms: report expiry, offer explicit new lobby, no fake seamless restore or imposed match-duration cap. Other games and unrelated hosting migration stay unchanged.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Private state leak -> use one projection for every outbound state path and payload-capture tests.
- Timer/callback ordering -> deterministic batch resolution, monotonic accumulator, receipt-time deadline validation.
- Recovery abuse -> cumulative budget, token validation/rotation, no code-only takeover.
- Vercel room loss -> explicit expiry tests and documented limits; actual WSS/public gameplay probes required.

## Migration Plan

Run Node24 clean install/typecheck/alltests/docs/pack. Commit scoped files on main and invoke checked-in release/deploy workflows with existing secrets. Stage checks must pass before promotion; rollback on failed public validation. Verify exact package asset and endpoint before client creation. After public game verification update both live-demo catalogs with its actual URL. Preserve unrelated changes and release-generated commits.

## Public admission regression repair

Staged release 38084815998 passed Tetris but exposed existing Bomberman/Combat/Ring Rivals admission failures. The pinned SDK reservation promise has no close-before-join rejection or handshake timeout. Use its protected room factory in an isolated subclass to attach close/abort/deadline handling, close failed sockets, and retain the exact reservation across bounded retries. Apply this only to existing private retry games plus Bomberman, preserving unrelated game lifecycles. Full/invalid-token responses remain terminal; no new room or extra seat is allocated. Verify focused lifecycle tests, real staged regressions, all local tests and package inclusion before retrying publication.
